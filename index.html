            <h2 class="heading">It's best to start off with myself!</h2>
            <p>I enjoy challenges and learning. I take pride in always trying. I oftentimes fail but I always want to learn from my mistakes, and when lucky, my successes.</p>
            <p>I always want to endeavour and just improve. So, I always enjoy criticisms.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>If you have any critques, I'm all ears!</dt>
                    <dd>Accepting criticisms and just being wrong is always scary. I don't want to be wrong, but what I realized is that I want to learn effectively 
                        and for that I want  gain other's insights and learn from my mistakes, to not be afraid of failure but to take pride in endeavouring.</dd>
                <dt>If you want a conversation, I'm here!</dt>
                    <dd>Tell me all about your experieneces. I want to soak it all up like a sponge.</dd>
                <br>
                <dt><strong>I want to get better and reach higher.</strong></dt>
                    <dd>I think this desire is in encapsulated in the words of poet Robert Browning:
                        <q><i>Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp Or what's a heaven for.</i></q>
                    </dd>

        <p>I enjoy learning and would enjoy learning from you, the reader, if given the opportunity.</p>
