        <h2>It's best to start off with myself!</h2>
        <p>I enjoy challenges and learning. I take pride in always trying. I oftentimes fail but I always want to learn from my mistakes, and when lucky, my successes.</p>
        <p>I always want to endeavour and just improve. So, I always enjoy criticisms.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>If you have any critques, I'm am all ears!</dt>
                <dd>Accepting criticisms and just being wrong is always scary. I don't want to be wrong, but what I realized is that I want to learn effectively 
                    and for that I want  gain other's insights and learn from my mistakes, to not be afraid of failure but to take pride in endeavouring.</dd>
            <dt>If you want a conversation, I'm here!</dt>
                <dd>Tell me all about your experieneces. I want to soak it all up like a sponge.</dd>
            <dt><strong>I want to get better and reach higher.</strong></dt>
                <dd>I think this desire is in encapsulated in the words of poet Robert Browning:
                    <q><i>Ah, but a man's reah should exceed his grsp Or what's a heaven for.</i></q>
